    <h2>Description</h2>
    Butter chicken is classic delicious Indian dish. It is so flavorful and easy to prepare. Add your favorite veggies
    to make it a complete meal. There has not been a single indian wedding I've been to that did not include butter
    chicken as a
    main dish. It can be made with chicken breasts but if you're a chef you have to go with dark meat. It is served over
    warm basmati rice along with some naan bread.
