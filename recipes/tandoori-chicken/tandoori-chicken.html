    <h6>Tandoori chicken is a indian dry dish traditionally made in a tandoor (an urn-shaped clay oven)</h6>
    <p>
    <h2>Description</h2>
    </p>
    Tandoori chicken is must have dry side dish loved for its spice and unique flavour. When paired with chatni (a herby
    yogurt dip) this combo gives the best of both worlds, spicy and sweet, hot and cool. This is an authentic recipe for
    tandoori chicken except cooked on a grill preferably charcoal. It can also be served with long-grain basmati rice,
    grilled veggies, roasted corn
    on the cob, and a cucumber salad. And then finished off with some kulfi (Indian ice cream).

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 pounds chicken, cut into pieces</li>
        <li>1 medium lemon, juiced</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 ¼ cups plain yogurt</li>
        <li>½ medium onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons garam masala</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon grated fresh ginger root</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon red food coloring</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon yellow food coloring</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons finely chopped cilantro</li>
        <li>1 medium lemon, cut into wedges</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Remove and discard skin from chicken pieces. Cut slits into meat and place into a shallow dish. Season
            chicken on both sides with lemon juice and salt. Let sit for 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Mix yogurt, onion, garlic, garam masada, ginger, and cayenne pepper together in a medium bowl until smooth,
            then stir in food coloring. Spread yogurt mixture over chicken, cover, and refrigerate for 6 to 24 hours
            (the longer the better).</li>
        <li>When ready to cook, preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate. Remove chicken
            from marinade. Discard remaining marinade.</li>
        <li>Cook chicken on the preheated grill until no longer pink and the juices run clear. An instant-read
            thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Garnish with cilantro and lemon
            wedges.</li>
    </ol>
