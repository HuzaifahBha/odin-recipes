    <h1>Odin Recipes</h1>
    <p><strong>Hot take:</strong> Growing up, my mother mostly made indian food and she absolutely mastered it. Indian food is the best
        tasting food in the world because of the variety of spices and seasonings used and
        its versatility in vegetables and meats. Its a very biased opinion but one backed by the greatest (most famous) chef
        in the world <strong>Gordon Ramsey.</strong> </p>
