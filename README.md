Before HTML: I will be creating a website using the HTML knowledge I have acquired so far from the Odin project. This will include the demonstration of the proper knowledge of elements and tags, as well as text, lists, links and images.

After HTML: I learned that coding takes along time and it can be redundant at times so it is key as a coder to learn short cuts when doing work for the sake of task completion but in this case, the task was to learn and demonstrate the skills I have in HTML. Thus it was important to take my time and do everything properly.

Before CSS: adding design and spicing a web page is very important but it takes time to learn and get used to. At this point I will demonstrate my basic understanding of selectors and declarations which will make this project look appealing to viewers
